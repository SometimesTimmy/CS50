What’s stdint.h?
What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
What does fseek do?
What is SEEK_CUR?

1.  #include stdint.h allows for the user to use 5 new types of integers.
2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t allows for the user to create unsigned integers of specific lenngth conveniently
3.  8, 32, 32, 16, respectively
4.  First two bytes in any BMP file are header fields 0x42 (hexadecimal)
5.  bfSize is the total size of the file in bytes (size of the image + file header + info header) while biSize is only the size of the image.
6.  If biHeight is positive, the image is bottom-up. If biHeight is negative, the image is top-down.
7.  biBitCount
8.  24: infile and 32: outfile may not exist.
9.  1 number of element to read corresponds to 1 byte, and in BMP, each pixel is represented by a byte.
10. 1
11. sets file position
12. change the location of the pointer fp from its current location
